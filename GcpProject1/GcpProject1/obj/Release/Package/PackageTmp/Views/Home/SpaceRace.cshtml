    <h1>Space Race</h1>

    <p>
        The heated competition between the US and the USSR to be the first in space was a defining component of the Cold War. The Space Race illustrates exactly what humanity can accomplish when it sets its mind to work.
    </p>
    <p>
        After working for a little over a decade, the United States was able to successfully execute a crewed lunar landing, all while using technology that, compared to today’s standards, was severely limited. The motivator for this accomplishment was Soviet competition. The resulting struggle on both sides for better equipment, engineers, and research pushed the envelope of technological advancement.

    <h2>Timeline</h2>

    <p>
        The Space Race officially began in 1955, during the Eisenhower administration in the US and Khrushchev’s leadership in the Soviet Union.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rocket technology was developed significantly during this period. Werner Von Braun (US) and Sergei Korolev (Soviet Union) were the lead development engineers in their respective countries. They each started with military rocket designs from WWII and experimented with them. From this basis of knowledge, they each worked to develop rockets capable of putting satellites into orbit.
    </p>
    <p>
        In late 1957, Korolev was the first to launch a successful artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into orbit using his R-7 Semyorka rocket, the first ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile). Von Braun and his team followed in early 1958 with the successful launch of Explorer 1 using the Juno 1 type rocket.
    </p>
    <p>
        The competition between Soviet Union and the United States continued as each country executed different projects, including more sophisticated satellites and eventually manned Earth orbit in 1961 (USSR) and 1962 (US).
    </p>
    <p>
        The United States eventually pulled ahead in the competition, with the development of the Apollo program. This program successfully sent a manned crew to the moon in 1969 using Von Braun’s Saturn V rocket. While it was developed specifically for the Apollo program, the Saturn V also eventually launched the first US space station.

    <h2>Product Development</h2>

    <p>
        Through the competition of the Space Race, many other products and technologies were developed. Some of the products, referred to as “spinoffs” by NASA, are shown below:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Freeze dried food</li>
        <li>Memory foam</li>
        <li>Wireless headsets</li>
        <li>Foil blankets</li>
        <li>Computer mouse</li>
        <li>Global Positioning System (GPS)</li>
        <li>and many more!</li>
    </ul>
