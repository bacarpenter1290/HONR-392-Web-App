    <h1>Nuclear Power</h1>

    <p>
        The Cold War was defined by the nuclear arms race between the USA and the USSR. Both countries struggled to have the biggest arsenal of nuclear weapons. Beyond the development of rocket-propelled nuclear warheads, both the USA and the USSR invested in nuclear technology as a source of power.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first nuclear reactor was successfully tested in 1942 as part of the Manhattan project, a program often noted for the development of the atomic bomb. The USA continued to research nuclear reactors as a power source, with the Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I) in Idaho becoming the first nuclear reactor to generate electricity. The US Navy developed a nuclear reactor to power the first nuclear submarine, the USS Nautilus, which launched in 1954.

        Both the USA and the USSR continued to invest in this new power source. The USSR constructed the Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant in 1954, successfully tying to the electric grid and generating 5MW. The USA responded in 1955 by building the BORAX III reactor which was able to power an entire community in Arco, Idaho.

        The associated technology continued to improve and the generating capacity of nuclear reactors dramatically increased. Despite well-known accidents in the development process like Three Mile Island (1979 - USA) and Chernobyl (1986 - USSR), nuclear energy is still viewed today as an efficient and safe form of electrical generation.
    </p>
    <p>
        By 1987, nuclear represented 16% of the world’s electrical generation portfolio. This is more than the current estimate by the <a href="https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/nuclear-power-in-the-world-today.aspx#:~:text=Nuclear%20energy%20now%20provides%20about,in%20about%20220%20research%20reactors.">World Nuclear Association</a>, who places the current contribution by nuclear reactors at approximately 10%.
