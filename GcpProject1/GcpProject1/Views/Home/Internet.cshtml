    <h1>ARPANET</h1>

    <p>The origins of the internet developed during the tensions of the Cold War. After the launch of the Sputnik 1 satellite, the USA began to be concerned that they were falling behind the USSR in technological development. With the transfer of all space-related projects to the newly established NASA in 1958, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) began to focus exclusively on computer science projects. ARPA’s new goal was to create a method for individual computers communicate with each other remotely.</p>

    <p>Throughout the 1960s, researchers at ARPA experimented with sending data long distances to remote computers via telephone line. Plagued by issues with speed and data integrity, this system was eventually redesigned to allow to data to pass short distances, bouncing between network “nodes” on the way to its destination. </p>

    <p>In 1969, the first computer network was successfully tested at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). This network, labeled the ARPANET, eventually expanded across the country. The primary users of ARPANET were academic researchers and the US military. </p>

    <p>While it was phased out and decommissioned in 1990, the research provided by ARPANET developers laid the ground work for aspects of the internet we know today, like TCP/IP protocols, data encryption, and password protection. </p>
